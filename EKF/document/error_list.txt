1/ while calc delVel, for get to do "delVel = np.dot(Cbn, delVel) - np.array([0, 0, 9.80665*dt])", delVel must be trans to navigation axis, and minus the effect of gravity. this may cause vel_z great, and corrupt the rpy(quarternion).
2/ if only update one dimension of x, then a hidden bug will cause by broadcast feature of numpy. Notice np.dot(k_mag, H_gps_heading) may equal to a float, not 16*16 matrix. we must make sure H_gps_heading has dimension 1*16, so need double [], not single []. Then k_mag has dimension 16*1 and H_gps_heading has dimension 1*16.   ---------cost a lot time as not familar with Numpy matrix.
